# Printer

A service «to print» documents into various office formats.

Printer is like a web-browser - it receives «instructions» in an XML document and renders them to the document in requested format.
It supports scripting through JSR.
No templating or processing capabilities, for this use another service called Reporter (not implemented yet).

For more detailed description see [documentation](./docs/index.md).
